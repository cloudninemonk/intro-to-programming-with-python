# What does the following code print?

def scream(words):
    return words + '!!!!'

scream('Yipeee')

# MY RESPONSE:

# It does not print anything as no print function has been stated.


# LAUNCH SCHOOL'S ANSWER:

# This program doesn't output anything. The function returns a value, Yipeee!!!!, 
# but it doesn't do anything with it. In particular, it doesn't print it.
