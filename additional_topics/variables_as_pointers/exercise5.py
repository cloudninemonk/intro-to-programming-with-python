# Write some code to create a deep copy of the dict1 object and assign it to dict2. You should only modify the code where indicated.

# You may modify this line

# dict1 = {
#     'a': [[7, 1], ['aa', 'aaa']],
#     'b': ([3, 2], ['bb', 'bbb']),
# }

# dict2 = ??? # You may modify the `???` part
#             # of this line

# # All of these should print False
# print(dict1         is dict2)
# print(dict1['a']    is dict2['a'])
# print(dict1['a'][0] is dict2['a'][0])

# My answer:

import copy

dict1 = {
    'a': [[7, 1], ['aa', 'aaa']],
    'b': ([3, 2], ['bb', 'bbb']),
}

dict2 = copy.deepcopy(dict1) 
                            

# All of these should print False
print(dict1         is dict2)
print(dict1['a']    is dict2['a'])
print(dict1['a'][0] is dict2['a'][0])
print(dict1['a'][1] is dict2['a'][1])
print(dict1['b']    is dict2['b'])
print(dict1['b'][0] is dict2['b'][0])
print(dict1['b'][1] is dict2['b'][1])


# Launch School's answer:

import copy

dict1 = {

    'b': ([3, 2], ['bb', 'bbb']),
}

dict2 = copy.deepcopy(dict1)

# Deep copies create entirely new objects, including their nested contents. We can use copy.deepcopy to create a deep copy.

# Note that we don't check the immutable contents of the nested objects inside each list value in the dictionaries. '
# 'Since they are all immutable, they weren't duplicated. Try it by adding these additional tests.

# All of these should print True
