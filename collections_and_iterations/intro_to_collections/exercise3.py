# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. 
# Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.


# My response:

# Differences:
# Lists are mutable tuples are not.
# Lists are enclosed by [ ] and tuples by ( ).

# Similarities:
# Both are heterogenous.
# Both are sequences.
# Both are ordered collections.
# Both are iterable


# Launch School's answer:

# Differences
# Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
# List literals use []; tuple literals use ().

# Similarities
# Lists and tuples are both sequences. Sequences are ordered collections that can use numeric indexes to access the members.
# Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to all be the same type.
