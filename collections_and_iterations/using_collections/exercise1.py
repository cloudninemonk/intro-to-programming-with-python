# Write Python code to print the seventh number of range(0, 25, 3).

# My response:

print(range(0, 25, 3)[6])
    

# Launch School's answer:

# Solution 1 (easy to read)

my_range = range(0, 25, 3)
print(my_range[6])                      # 18

# Solution 2 (not so easy to read)

print(range(0, 25, 3)[6])               # 18
